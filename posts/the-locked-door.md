**The Locked Door**

Fuck. I guess they're closed. Why are they closed at 5:48pm on a Sunday? What am I going to do now? 

Kat sat down beside me, ostensibly confused at why I'm just standing here instead of going in. I look around for other stores that might have dog food. Kat whimpers ever so slightly. My heart was cracked but now it's shattered.

I'm such a fucking idiot. Why didn't I check what time they close before leaving the house? 

I was thinking I'd stop by Target to get some shitty kibble for a night when someone ripped the door to the pet store open from the inside. I swing around to stare as they try and carry a large bag of new toys and food out of the store. I don't even offer to help. I just stare at the word I've only just seen as the door swings closed.

_PUSH_.
